    Tomorrowland is a large-scale annual electronic dance music festival held in Boom, Antwerp, Belgium. Taking place within De Schorre provincial recreational park, it debuted in 2005, from an idea conceived by brothers Manu and Michiel Beers.[4] Since then, Tomorrowland has become one of the best known music festivals in the world. It has won numerous accolades and awards, including being voted five times in a row as "best musical event of the year" at the International Dance Music Awards. It employs 80 people year-round for the organisation and 15,000 people during the event.
